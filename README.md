# G--
Garbage collection compiler for C++

#### How to use
1. Clone this repository to your computer and add it to your PATH.
2. Enter `g-- <file_name>` to compile your file, with `<file_name>` being the path to your file. The compiler will change your file "directly" so that you can easily use the normal compiler right after (like g++) :)
